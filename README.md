# Enhanced Traceability System

## Summary

The goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive system for the tracking of the production of Cakesmiths baked goods from their beginnings as raw ingredients, to their point of sale. 

## Expectation of finalizes product
The aim is to provide a piece of desktop software that provides accurate tracking of the production process, easy information retrieval, and intuitive visualization on the efficiency of their production lines. Aside from the desktop application, the system will also require an auxiliary platform for the real-time input of data during the production and delivery processes.

The intended use of the software is for warehouse & factory staff to be able to log the delivery of goods to their premises, and then log further information regarding the production & sale of Cakesmiths products. This data will then be available to directors & managers in such a way that they can clearly visualize the provenance of all products and the day to day efficiency of their operations. At most, the only personal data that might be required will be that of email addresses, passwords, and role for the creation of user accounts.
## MVP
A simple stock control system that stores information about a product at every stage of its production. Can be database initially without a UI for now. Some statistics for directors.
