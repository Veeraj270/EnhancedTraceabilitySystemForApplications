# Enhanced Traceability System

## Client Needs:
From the brief:
>For the system to be workable we will require a lot of background systems which will include:
Recipe system\n
Approved supplier system\n
Stock control system
Production planning system
Raw material specification system.
All the above will feed into a fully integrated stock control system.
Feeding into the production system we will have to have the following:
Line standards for the product
QAS for every stage of manufacturing
Line throughput standards
Give away at every stage of production.
Losses at every stage of the product
We will also require a deviation report
At the end of the project, we would the solution to be closed source.
