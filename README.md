# Enhanced Traceability System

## Client Needs:
From the brief:
>For the system to be workable we will require a lot of background systems which will include:<br>
Recipe system<br> 
Approved supplier system<br> 
Stock control system<br>
Production planning system<br>
Raw material specification system.<br>
All the above will feed into a fully integrated stock control system.<br>
Feeding into the production system we will have to have the following:<br>
Line standards for the product<br>
QAS for every stage of manufacturing<br>
Line throughput standards<br>
Give away at every stage of production.<br>
Losses at every stage of the product<br>
We will also require a deviation report<br>
At the end of the project, we would the solution to be closed source.
